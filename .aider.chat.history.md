#### Write a simple code for Java  

Sure, here is a simple code for Java:

```java
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }

#### Write a simple Java code into this file please  

Sure, here is a simple Java code:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }

#### Replace "Hello" by "Goodbye"  

Sure, I can help you with that. Here are the steps involved:

1. Determine if any code changes are needed.
2. Explain any needed changes.
3. If changes are needed, output a copy of each file that needs changes.

Let's start by taking a look at the code you provided.

```
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

This code is a simple Java program that prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console. It does not need any changes.

Here is the updated code:

```
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Goodbye, World!");
    }
}
```

This code prints the message "Goodbye, World!" to the console.
